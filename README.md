A Heuristic-Based Scalable Goal Assignment Algorithm for Multi-Robot Systems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the implementation of the proposed approach as well as the baseline algorithm used in the following paper: 

**Aakash and Indranil Saha. It Costs to Get Costs! A Heuristic-Based Scalable Goal Assignment Algorithm for Multi-Robot Systems. In ICAPS 2022.**

***If you use or adapt the code (either a snippet or an entire module) from this repository, it is requested to cite the above paper.***


Few points:

- Execute ```python3 start_main.py``` command to trigger the execution. 

- User will be asked for inputs on the screen.

- The naive_approach.py file has the implementation for the baseline algorithm.

- The heuristic_approach.py has the implementation for our approach (Algorithm 1 in the paper).

- Both heuristic_approach.py and naive_approach.py use the common functionalities from the utils folder. 

- The standard workspaces are provided in benchmark_maps folder and are ready-to-use.
